# loc-lm-bench -- Implementation Plan (forward work)

Forward-only: every task line in this file must describe work that remains. Current behavior,
operator workflows, durable evidence, and design decisions live in [`current.md`](current.md) and
the topic files under [`current/`](current/). The product spec lives in
[`docs/design/spec.md`](../design/spec.md).

## Forward Tasks

The forward work is split into two sections by **who must act to complete it**:

- **[Agent Implementation Tasks](#agent-implementation-tasks)** land to `make ci` green with
  committed fixtures, injected fakes, and deterministic harnesses. A few carry a heavy real-model
  run for durable evidence; those runs are deterministic and execute on the CUDA host without any
  human judgment, so they stay in this section.
- **[Human-Assisted Tasks](#human-assisted-tasks)** cannot reach their stated acceptance without a
  human in the loop: the deliverable *is* human judgment (verification-gate reviews, drafting
  oversight, measured reviewer throughput) or requires a human authorization (egress consent +
  API spend). An agent can still build the supporting code and unit tests; the marked **human
  step** is what gates completion.

Task numbers are stable ids and never change; every task carries an explicit `Dependencies` line,
and the recommended build order within each section follows those lines.

For remaining tasks that depend on retrieval behavior, use the current RAG baseline documented in
[RAG core](current/rag-core.md) and the mixed-corpus ingestion baseline documented in
[data prep](current/data-prep.md).

Every task below carries an explicit `Agent status` line with one of four markers:

- **CLEAR** -- agent-buildable to `make ci` green with fixtures/fakes; no run evidence, no human
  gate.
- **RUN NEEDED** -- agent-buildable, but acceptance requires a heavy deterministic run; every dev
  box is a proper CUDA host, so the agent executes these runs itself on the current machine.
- **BLOCKED BY HUMAN** -- the acceptance gate consumes an artifact only a human step can produce.
- **HUMAN-GATED** -- the deliverable itself is human judgment or authorization; supporting code and
  unit tests are agent-buildable.

## Agent Implementation Tasks

Add new agent-buildable work here per [Adding Future Tasks](#adding-future-tasks).

### category-suite-throughput-vram

- Agent status: **CLEAR** -- agent-buildable to `make ci` green; the shared `ThroughputMeter` +
  `complete_all` already exist in `bench/common.py` (see
  [category suite](current/category-benchmark-suite.md)).
- Dependencies: none. `bench-security` already reports real generation `tok/s`; the other category
  runners (`bench-tooling`, `bench-agentic`, `bench-summarization`, `bench-structured`,
  `bench-text-analysis`) still hardcode `tokens_per_s: 0.0` and pass no VRAM.
- User-visible outcome: every category board shows real throughput, not `0.0`, and (optionally) a
  best-effort peak VRAM so the speed/VRAM columns and Pareto flag are meaningful across the suite.
- Scope boundary: in scope -- thread a `ThroughputMeter` through each category runner exactly as
  `bench-security` does (create in the CLI, pass to `drive_with_backend` + the runner, read
  `tokens_per_s` into `category_result` + `RunMetrics`); optionally surface peak VRAM by returning
  the isolate-cell VRAM sample from `drive_with_backend` for launched backends, and a single
  best-effort GPU sample for the out-of-process Ollama path (clearly labelled non-PID-attributed).
  Out of scope -- changing any category's RANKING (they rank on objective quality within their
  tier; tok/s/VRAM stay display + Pareto only).
- Acceptance gates: each category manifest carries a non-zero `tokens_per_s` on a real run; a unit
  test per runner asserts a meter's throughput reaches the board row (mirroring
  `test_run_security_reports_meter_throughput`).
- Documentation target: [category suite](current/category-benchmark-suite.md) per-category notes.

## Human-Assisted Tasks

Each task's code and unit tests are agent-buildable; the marked **human step** is what gates
completion.

Remaining human step: task 2's egress consent and spend decision, whenever the operator is ready to
authorize it.

### 2. frontier-ua-draft-lane

- Agent status: **HUMAN-GATED** -- human egress consent + API spend authorization gate the real
  2-document frontier probe; all code and fake-completer tests are CLEAR (agent-buildable now, no
  network).
- Dependencies: none (code reuses `src/llb/prep/frontier.py`). Human step: the real-frontier
  2-document probe requires **human egress consent and API spend** under the recorded egress policy;
  the code and all fake-completer tests are agent-buildable without any network call.
- User-visible outcome: for the best Ukrainian question quality and completeness, an operator
  can opt a draft run into a best-of-breed external API (litellm-routed) for extraction,
  drafting, or both, with an explicit consent gate, a hard budget cap, per-call cost telemetry
  in provenance, and a side-by-side local-vs-frontier yield and quality report over the same
  seeds. Frontier cross-check exists (`make cross-check-goldset CROSS_CHECK_MODEL=`); the draft
  lane does not.
- Scope boundary: in scope -- a frontier endpoint option for the ontology pipeline reusing the
  litellm conventions in `src/llb/prep/frontier.py` behind the same endpoint seam as Ollama and
  vLLM drafting (`src/llb/prep/ontology/endpoint.py`); `--max-usd` and `--max-calls` guards
  that abort cleanly and record the reason; an interactive egress consent prompt naming the
  corpus and destination (policy stays as recorded in
  [product decisions](current/scope-boundaries.md)); a `llb draft-compare` command that drafts
  the same bounded seed subset locally and via frontier and reports kept-yield, gate results,
  and verify-sample accept rate. Out of scope -- making frontier the default, egress for
  scoring or judging, retries of the egress policy discussion.
- Data and artifact paths: `provenance.json` gains `endpoint.cost_usd`, call counts, and
  latency; comparison reports under `$DATA_DIR/draft-compare/<timestamp>/`.
- Execution path:
  `make prepare-goldset-draft DRAFT_ENDPOINT=frontier DRAFT_FRONTIER_MODEL=<litellm-id>
  DRAFT_MAX_USD=<n>`; `llb draft-compare --corpus-root <dir> --seeds <n> --frontier-model <id>
  --local-model <model>`; unit tests use an injected fake litellm completer.
- Acceptance gates: no network call happens without the flag plus consent (unit-tested via the
  injected completer); the budget guard aborts mid-draft and the bundle remains inspectable
  with the abort recorded; a 2-document probe against a real frontier model passes bundle gates
  with parse rate at least matching the local drafter; the comparison report ranks both lanes
  on kept-yield and accept rate.
- Documentation target: [data prep](current/data-prep.md) frontier lane notes;
  [`docs/guides/data-prep/goldset-from-scratch.md`](../guides/data-prep/goldset-from-scratch.md).

## Adding Future Tasks

Add a task only when there is concrete forward work with enough detail for an engineer or an
agent to execute without guessing. Use a stable descriptive id such as `platform-matrix-power`
or `prompt-system-tuning`; keep the id only while work remains under it. Place it under
**Agent Implementation Tasks** if it can land to `make ci` green with fixtures/fakes (heavy
deterministic runs on the CUDA host are fine), or under **Human-Assisted Tasks** if a human
review/judgment or authorization gates completion; either way give it a `Dependencies` line and
mark any cross-section block explicitly.

Each task entry must include:

- Dependencies: prerequisite tasks (by number/id), any cross-section block, and -- for
  human-assisted tasks -- the specific human step that gates completion.
- User-visible outcome: what new capability or decision the work should create.
- Scope boundary: what is in scope, what is explicitly out of scope, and which existing modules or
  commands should be reused.
- Data and artifact paths: expected corpus, gold set, config, `$DATA_DIR/<method>/<run>/` outputs,
  and any committed `samples/` outputs.
- Execution path: commands, manual run steps, required local services, and any heavy/dependent steps
  that must stay outside quick CI.
- Acceptance gates: tests, lint/type checks, retrieval thresholds, score comparison method, or manual
  evidence required before the item leaves this file.
- Documentation target: the narrow `docs/impl/current/*.md` topic and any guide that should receive
  the resulting behavior and run notes.

When a task surfaces new future work, add that as a new forward task. Put current behavior and
durable decisions in current docs, never in this plan.
