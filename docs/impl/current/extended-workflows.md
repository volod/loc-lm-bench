# Extended Workflows

Extended workflows cover comparison axes that sit beside the main RAG leaderboard: agentic
harnesses, judge diagnostics, and prompt-system packages.

## Agentic Harness Comparison

The agentic benchmark can run the same task set through multiple harnesses while keeping the model,
tools, world state, objective checks, and optional judge fixed.

Core locations:

- `src/llb/bench/agentic.py`: `Harness` protocol, harness names, runner integration;
- `src/llb/bench/harness/base.py`: pure loop harness;
- `src/llb/bench/harness/langgraph.py`: LangGraph agent/tool graph;
- `src/llb/bench/harness/crewai.py`: CrewAI adapter;
- `src/llb/board/harnesses.py`: one-model harness comparison board rows.

```bash
llb bench-agentic --harness loop --model <model> --backend <backend>
llb bench-agentic --harness langgraph --model <model> --backend <backend>
llb bench-agentic --harness crewai --model <model> --backend <backend>
llb bench-agentic-compare --model <model>
make agentic-harness-compare MODEL=<model> BACKEND=<backend>
```

The comparison fixes the model and treats harness as the row label. This avoids conflating model
quality with orchestration behavior.

CrewAI is optional and lazy-imported. The adapter wraps the candidate completion function as a
CrewAI LLM, builds tools from the benchmark tool definitions, and disables telemetry/tracing for a
local no-egress run.

The `[crewai]` extra is a standalone install lane in `uv`: upstream CrewAI pins older Chroma,
LanceDB, and `tomli` ranges than the repo's RAG/vector/dev extras. `pyproject.toml` declares those
extra conflicts so `uv lock` stays resolvable while `uv pip install -e ".[crewai]"` still works for
host validation.

## Judge Diagnostics

`src/llb/scoring/judge_diag.py` classifies zero-valued judge outcomes so a diagnostic score can be
read correctly:

- `empty_answer`: candidate produced nothing useful;
- `malformed_judge_json`: judge endpoint failed strict JSON expectations;
- `judge_transport_error`: judge endpoint failed transport;
- `zero_score`: judge returned a valid zero.

`run_gated_judge` attaches diagnostics to category judge outcomes, and category manifests carry the
summary under judge metadata. `bench-agentic` also echoes the diagnostic summary.

Before a long judged run, use:

```bash
llb judge-smoke --judge-model <model> --judge-base-url <url>
```

The smoke check runs one grounded case and exits non-zero with a reason when the judge cannot
return a well-formed non-zero strict-JSON score.

## Prompt-System Packages

`src/llb/prompt_system/` builds reviewable RAG prompt-system candidates from a corpus. The package
is deterministic and manifest-addressable so prompt changes become explicit experiment variables.

Important modules:

- `corpus.py`: reads `.md`/`.txt`, keeps exact spans, selects anthology passages, builds metadata;
- `budget.py`: token-budget planning and section trimming;
- `template.py`: prompt fields and `PromptPackage.apply`;
- `tuning.py`: candidate grid and deduplication;
- `review.py`: approve, pin, reject, and persist candidate review state;
- `manifest.py`: corpus, mapping, template digests, and stable prompt-system ids;
- `selection.py`: resolves a selected package for `run-eval`.

```bash
llb prompt-system-prepare --corpus-root <dir> --out-dir <review-dir>
llb prompt-system-review --run-dir <review-dir> --action summary
llb prompt-system-review --run-dir <review-dir> --action pin --id <prompt-id>
llb run-eval --prompt-system <prompt-id> --prompt-package <review-dir> ...
llb prompt-system-compare --lane rag --model <model>
```

`run-eval` prepends the selected prompt package to the normal RAG generation prompt and records
`prompt_system_provenance` in the manifest. Board loaders can rank one model across prompt-system
ids for RAG or agentic lanes.

## Sample Prompt Assets

The IP regulation samples provide a small checked prompt-system fixture:

- `samples/goldsets/ip_regulation_uk/`;
- `samples/prompt_system/ip_regulation_uk/`;
- `samples/prompt_system/ip_regulation_uk/tuned/`;
- `samples/prompt_system/ip_regulation_uk/graph/`.

These samples are useful for local prompt-system mechanics and board rendering. Treat tuning wins
as provisional until a held-out final split confirms them; the prompt-system lane exists to make
that split discipline visible.

## Local Self-Improvement Loop

The self-improvement workflow closes the loop from a measured local RAG run to an adapter-backed
candidate row. It is file-driven and split-guarded:

- `src/llb/finetune/dataset.py` exports SFT records and optional DPO preference pairs from a
  finalized tuning-split run bundle. The exporter renders `eval.rag.chat` messages through the
  same prompt path as `run-eval`, writes `sft.jsonl`, `dpo.jsonl`, and `dataset_manifest.json`,
  and records the item ids, split counts, source run, and dataset digest.
- `src/llb/finetune/trainer.py` trains LoRA/QLoRA adapters behind a trainer seam. `--trainer fake`
  writes deterministic CI artifacts; the real path lazy-imports PEFT, TRL, Transformers, and
  Datasets from the `[finetune]` extra and saves an adapter plus `adapter_manifest.json`.
- `src/llb/finetune/guard.py` enforces the contamination invariant before `run-eval` launches a
  backend: adapter manifests may contain only tuning-split training ids, may not intersect
  calibration/final eval ids, and a tuned model cannot judge itself.
- `src/llb/finetune/loop.py` orchestrates base final eval, per-round tuning eval, miss analysis,
  dataset export, adapter training, adapter final eval, stop/accept logic, `state.json`, and
  `report.md`.
- `src/llb/finetune/campaign.py` schedules the loop ingredients across a `--models` roster with
  planner skip reasons, a shared campaign SFT export, per-model preference exports, VRAM reclaim
  between roster entries, `campaign.progress.jsonl` resume, and a tunability `report.md`.
- `src/llb/finetune/registry.py`, `lifecycle.py`, and `serving.py` make adapters first-class,
  traceable artifacts (see [Adapter Registry And Lifecycle](#adapter-registry-and-lifecycle)).

Commands:

```bash
llb export-finetune-set --run-dir <tuning-run> --goldset <goldset> --out <dataset-dir>
llb finetune-adapter --dataset <dataset-dir> --model <model> --seed <seed>
llb self-improve --model <model> --backend vllm --goldset <goldset> --rounds 2
llb finetune-campaign --models <m1,m2> --backend vllm \
  --goldset <goldset> --corpus <corpus-dir> --rounds 1
make self-improve MODEL=<model> BACKEND=vllm GOLDSET=<goldset> ROUNDS=2
make finetune-campaign MODELS=<m1,m2> BACKEND=vllm GOLDSET=<goldset> CORPUS=<corpus-dir>
```

Artifacts live under `$DATA_DIR/self-improve/<timestamp>/round-<n>/` for campaign state and under
`$DATA_DIR/run-eval/` for canonical board bundles. Round directories carry `dataset/`, `adapter/`,
`run` and `run-final` pointers, plus per-round reports.

Multi-model campaign artifacts live under `$DATA_DIR/finetune-campaign/<timestamp>/`. The campaign
root contains `shared-dataset/dataset_manifest.json`, `campaign.progress.jsonl`, `report.md`, and
one directory per roster model. Each model directory records base-final and per-round tuning/final
run pointers, miss analysis, a per-model preference dataset, and the final adapter. Resume replays
`campaign.progress.jsonl` and does not retrain a completed roster entry.

Adapter-backed `run-eval` rows are labeled `<base>+adapter-<digest>` in manifests and board loaders.
`llb recommend` appends a self-improvement section when a campaign `state.json` exists and a
fine-tune campaign section when `$DATA_DIR/finetune-campaign/*/campaign.progress.jsonl` exists. The
campaign section ranks completed models by final-split delta, then shorter training wall-clock, then
lower peak VRAM; skipped models remain visible with the planner reason.

Tests:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_finetune.py tests/test_adapter_registry.py tests/test_recommend.py
```

The campaign implementation is covered by fake eval/trainer/planner tests for scheduling order,
planner skip reasons, shared dataset digest reuse, JSONL resume, and report ranking.

## Adapter Registry And Lifecycle

Adapters are first-class artifacts, not loose directories. `$DATA_DIR/adapters/registry.jsonl` is an
append-only event log (`register` / `merge` / `delete`) folded into the current entry set on read, so
a partial write can never lose earlier history. The entry id IS the `adapter_digest`, so it can never
be reassigned to different weights.

Modules:

- `src/llb/finetune/registry.py`: `AdapterEntry`, the event log, `register_adapter` (idempotent --
  an unchanged re-registration appends nothing), `resolve_adapter` (id / unique prefix / label /
  directory), and `staleness`;
- `src/llb/finetune/lifecycle.py`: run-bundle citation scan, supersession, and garbage collection;
- `src/llb/finetune/serving.py`: the serve plan, the cached merge lane, and the backend seam.

```bash
llb register-adapter --adapter-dir <dir> [--goldset <g>] [--corpus <c>] [--source-run <run>]
llb list-adapters [--json]
llb serve-adapter --adapter <id> --backend vllm|ollama|llamacpp [--smoke]
llb gc-adapters [--dry-run] [--force]
llb run-eval --adapter <id> --model <base> --backend vllm
make list-adapters ; make serve-adapter ADAPTER=<id> BACKEND=<b> ; make gc-adapters GC_DRY_RUN=1
```

Entries record the base model, dataset digest, dataset item ids and split counts, the goldset and
corpus digests observed AT TRAINING TIME, the source run, and an eval summary. Self-improvement and
campaign rounds auto-register through `register_round_adapter` after the adapter's own final eval,
so the entry carries the evidence the board later cites. Registration is best-effort: an injected
trainer that writes no `adapter_manifest.json` logs a warning instead of aborting the round. A bare
`llb finetune-adapter` does not register, so `llb register-adapter` exists to adopt a hand-trained
adapter into the registry rather than leave its board row silently dropped.

### Staleness

`staleness()` compares the recorded goldset/corpus digests against the present ones
(`durability.goldset_digest` and `corpus_governance.corpus_fingerprint`, the same functions the
durable-run journal and the stale-store check use). Verdicts are `current`, `stale`, and `unknown`;
a missing digest yields `unknown` and never `current`. Detection reports, it never retrains.

`board/runs.py` resolves every adapter-backed bundle through the registry before it can rank:

- an unregistered adapter's row is DROPPED (a tuned number nobody can trace is not comparable);
- a registered-but-stale adapter's row is stamped `<base>+adapter-<digest> [stale]`.

`recommend.load_run_summaries` reuses `load_run_records`, so both the board and `llb recommend`
inherit the rule from one seam.

### Contamination guard through the registry

`validate_adapter_for_eval` reads training provenance from the registry when the adapter is
registered, falling back to `adapter_manifest.json` only when it is not (a freshly trained adapter
registers after its first eval). The manifest beside the weights is operator-writable, so a
hand-edited one could otherwise launder a final-split adapter past the gate. The refusal message
names the intersecting ids, the offending splits, and which provenance was consulted.

### Serving

vLLM serves the LoRA directly through the existing `--enable-lora --lora-modules` wiring. Ollama and
llama.cpp serve whole model artifacts, so `serving.py` merges the adapter into its base weights
(PEFT `merge_and_unload`), converts to GGUF via the llama.cpp checkout's `convert_hf_to_gguf.py`, and
for Ollama registers a `llb-adapter-<short-id>` tag. The merge is expensive and one-way, so it is
cached under `$DATA_DIR/adapters/merged/<short-id>/<backend>/` behind a `merge.json` and recorded as
a registry `merge` event. Both the merge and the launcher are injectable, so CI exercises all three
backends without CUDA, llama.cpp, or a running Ollama daemon. `serve-adapter` probes the endpoint
with one generation and then holds it in the foreground until Ctrl-C; there is no serving daemon.

### Garbage collection

An adapter is superseded once a newer adapter exists for the same base model, ordered by
`(created_at, log sequence)`. `created_at` has second resolution, so two fast rounds tie; the
append-log position breaks the tie exactly. Only superseded adapters are GC candidates, and GC
refuses any that a published run bundle cites (matched by recorded digest or by served
`adapter_path`). `--force` overrides the citation refusal but never the safety rule that GC only
deletes directories inside `$DATA_DIR`. Deletions append a `delete` tombstone.

### Committed fixtures

- `samples/finetune/registry/registry.jsonl`: a stale entry (with a folded `merge` event) and a
  poisoned-digest entry, both pointing at adapter dirs outside `$DATA_DIR`;
- `samples/finetune/stale-adapter/`: recorded digests that no longer match
  `samples/goldsets/ip_regulation_uk/`;
- `samples/finetune/laundered-adapter/`: an `adapter_manifest.json` that CLAIMS a clean tuning-only
  training set while the registry records the `final`-split ids it was really trained on;
- `samples/finetune/poisoned-adapter/`: the simpler case where the manifest itself declares the
  protected split, refused even when unregistered.

`tests/test_adapter_registry.py` covers registry round-trip and idempotence, the staleness flip when
the goldset digest changes, the `unknown` verdict, guard resolution through the registry, serving
smoke over a fake launcher for all three backends, merge-event recording and merge caching, GC
citation refusal plus `--force`, the same-second supersession tie, the outside-`$DATA_DIR` safety
rule, and board drop/stamp behavior.
